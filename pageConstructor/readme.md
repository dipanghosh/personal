# Working with the PageMaker tool

The script is intended for creating webpages for my website quickly. The rules are simple

1. Put images in a directory, make sure images are named as {imagename}-web.jpg. The thumbnails goes in the thumb subdirectory inside the parent directory, and the thumbnails are named as {imagename}-thumb.jpg

2. The pagemaker script can be anywhere. Edit the pagemaker.py script with relevant information. Make sure the path ends with \\

3. Thats it, the file is created at the directory its pointed to.
